Each event contains an offset that denotes its location on the stream. If a client disconnects for any reason, it should reconnect with instructions to start at the last offset it successfully processed, to avoid missing any data.

Each non-empty line in the response represents a single event.\n\nThis response body is of arbitrarily large size. As long as the connection is open, Airship will continue to write to the data stream. If no events have been dispatched down a connection for some time, the API will write to the connection to prevent it from being closed for inactivity. By default, only a blank line (a single newline character) will be written. If the `enable_offset_updates` field on the request is `true`, then instead of a blank line, an event will be written with type `OFFSET_UPDATE`. These events have no `body` or `device` field, and always have `occurred` and `processed` times indicating when they were sent. The `offset` field will contain the offset of the last event considered for inclusion in the stream whether or not it was actually sent.
