# Airship RTDS JSON Schema [Deprecated]

This repository contains JSON Schema files representing event payloads used in the Airship Real Time Data Streaming API (RTDS), as well as the full Open API specification in JSON format. The JSON Schema files conform to JSON Schema Draft 04. It has been deprecated in favor of a unified repository dedicated to Open API specifications for all Airship APIs.
