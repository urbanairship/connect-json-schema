# Airship RTDS JSON Schema

This repository contains JSON Schema files representing event payloads used in the Airship Real Time Data Streaming API (RTDS), as well as the full Open API specification in JSON format. The JSON Schema files currently conform to JSON Schema Draft 04.

We will be deprecating this in the near future, in favor of a unified repository dedicated to Open API specifications for all Airship APIs. Once deprecated, this repository will no longer receive updates and will link to the new content.
