There is no guarantee that push body events (defined in Push Body Event) for the child pushes fulfilling a group will appear in the stream.\n\n**Note:** When you start, pause, or publish a journey, Airship emits a `push_body` event for the journey itself, and each message contained within the journey (i.e. messages +1). After you start a journey, Airship does not issue subsequent `push_body` events for the journey unless you pause or publish changes to the journey.\n",
